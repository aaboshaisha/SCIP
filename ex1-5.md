Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative- order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

(define (p) (p)) 

(define (test x y)
    (if (= x 0) 0 y))

Then he evaluates the expression

(test 0 (p))

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evalu- ation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative ex- pression.)

Applicaitve order evaluation:

This "evaluate arguments then apply" will work as follows:

(test 0 (p)) 
eval test, eval 0, eval (p)

eval test:

(if (= x 0) 0 y) 

eval 0: 0

eval (p) : (p)

now we'll have:
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))

and since we're in "evaluate args then apply" we still need to evaluate (p) so which evluates to (p) and so on. We get an infinite loop.

Normal-order evaluation:

"fully expand then reduce" + donot evaluate arguments until their values are needed (substitute operand expressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators) 

(test 0 (p)) -> expand test

( (if (= x 0) 0 y))

replace formal params with args

(( if (= 0 0) 0 (p))

Now operand expression has only primitive "if"

if (= 0 0) evaluates to #t and gives 0. (p) is never visited.
