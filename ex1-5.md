Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative- order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

(define (p) (p)) 

(define (test x y)
    (if (= x 0) 0 y))

Then he evaluates the expression

(test 0 (p))

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evalu- ation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative ex- pression.)

--Answer-----
Applicaitve order evaluation:

(test 0 (p)) means x = 0, y = (p) 
if x = 0, we get 0 so won't even visit (p)

another way:

(test 0 (p)) -> (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) -> (if #t 0 (p)) -> 0 

Normal-order evaluation:

(test 0 (p)) -> needs to expand (p) -> which calls (p) and we get an infinite loop. 

ie: (test 0 (p)) -> (p) -> (p) -> (p) -> ....
