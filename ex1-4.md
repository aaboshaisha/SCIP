Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expres- sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b) 
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

Ans: What this procedure says is:
If a > b, do a + b
Else do a - b (when b is < 0 this - makes it positive ie: doing abs)
The operator to (# a b) procedure is the compund expression (if (> b 0) + -) which returns an operation / primitive procedure (+ or -) to be performed on a & b.
