Exercise 1.10: The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann’s function.

```
(define (A x y) (cond ((= y 0) 0)
((= x 0) (* 2 y))
((= y 1) 2)
(else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?
```
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```
Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```
(define (f n) (A 0 n)) 
(define (g n) (A 1 n)) 
(define (h n) (A 2 n)) 
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```
Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions com- puted by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer val- ues of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n2.


-- Ans --- I only expanded the first one by hand

```
(A 1 10)
(A 0 (A 1 9))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 6)))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 5))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 4)))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 3))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2)))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 16))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 32)))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 64))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 128)))
(A 0 (A 0 256))
(A 0 512)
1024
```

`(A 2 4) = 65536`
`(A 3 3) = 65536`

I then computed the following

```
(0, 0) 0
(0, 1) 2
(0, 2) 4
(0, 3) 6
(0, 4) 8
(0, 5) 10
(0, 6) 12
(0, 7) 14
(0, 8) 16
(0, 9) 18

(1, 0) 0
(1, 1) 2
(1, 2) 4
(1, 3) 8
(1, 4) 16
(1, 5) 32
(1, 6) 64
(1, 7) 128
(1, 8) 256
(1, 9) 512

(2, 0) 0
(2, 1) 2
(2, 2) 4
(2, 3) 16
(2, 4) 65536
(2, 5) -> a ridiculously huge number that Python couldn’t compute (but MIT Scheme did).
```

We can see from it that:

```
(A 0 n) -> 2*n
(A 1 n) -> 2^n
(A 2 n) -> 2^{(n -1)x2}
```
