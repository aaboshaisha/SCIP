Exercise 1.6: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause) 
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
          (else else-clause)))

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5) 

>> 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5) 

>> 0


Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x) 
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
                guess
                (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

--Ans----
We run out of memory. 
Why? 

The basic rule of evaluating combinations (section 1.1.3 from the book):

1- Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
2- Apply the operator to the operands 

ie: we must first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination.


And for procedure evaluation we see in section 1.1.5

"To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound proce- dure, the interpreter follows much the same process as for combina- tions whose operators name primitive procedures" 

"To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument." 

The first procedure to be evaluated is:

(sqrt x)

We begin by retrieving the body of sqrt

(sqrt-iter 1.0 x)

We retrieve the body of sqrt-iter (we also would replace formal parameter x by value provided by user eg 9 if asking for (sqrt 9) )

(new-if good-enough? 1.0 9.0) 

we still have a formal argument / subexpression for new-if not evaluated that is "good-enough?" and same for new-if

(cond (good-enough? 1.0) 1.0 (else sqrt-iter (improve guess 9.0) 9.0)))  

Now good-enough? needs to expand, improve, but also "sqrt-iter" which gets us into an infinite loop. 

So, why using "if" doesn't produce that? 

Because "if" is a special form not a procedure. 

"To evaluate an if expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the ⟨predicate⟩ part of the expression. If the ⟨predicate⟩ evaluates to a true value, the interpreter then evaluates the ⟨consequent⟩ and returns its value. Otherwise it evaluates the ⟨alternative⟩ and returns its value." 

And this means, only one branch gets evaluated at a time (without needing to expand the other at the same time). This allows us to avoid infinite loops.
