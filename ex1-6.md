Exercise 1.6: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause) 
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
          (else else-clause)))

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5) 

>> 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5) 

>> 0


Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x) 
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
                guess
                (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

--Ans----
We run out of memory. 
Why?

The basic rule of evaluating combinations (section 1.1.3 from the book):

1- Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
2- Apply the operator to the operands 

ie: we must first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination.

The answer lies in the difference between cond and if:

cond:

Conditional expressions are of the form 

```
cond ((<p1> <e1>) 
      (<p2> <e2>)
        .....
      (<pn> <en>))
```

And it will evaluate <p1> and if false <p2> and so on till it finds a <pn> that is true (otherwise, its value will be undefined). else is a special casethat if none of the <pn> is true, the <e> of the else will be the value of the whole conditional. 

Let's apply all this to the new-if above:


For cond to work, each expression's predicate <pn> needs to be evaluated. This means the interpreter always needs to evaluate both branches (one of which is sqrt-iter the recursive call) even if <p1> is true and we have found the sqrt and should terminate. 

if, is a special form. It therefore doesn't evaluate both its <consequent> and <alternative> expressions (the alternative calls sqrt-iter) once it has found the right answer.
